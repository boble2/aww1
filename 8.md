Go (programming language) Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google [12] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. [13] It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, [7] and CSP -style concurrency. [14]
